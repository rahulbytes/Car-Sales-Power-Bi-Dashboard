**Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard in Excel**

This project provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing coffee shop sales data, helping you gain valuable insights into customer behavior, product popularity, and sales trends.

**Data Acquisition and Cleaning**

1. **Dataset Source:** The data for this dashboard originated from the Data Playground option of Maven Analytics.
2. **Power Query Transformation:**
   - **Data Cleansing:** The `Datetime` column was split into separate `Date` and `Time` columns for enhanced analysis.
   - **Product Name Parsing:** Cup sizes were extracted from product names using a combination of `Text.Split`, `Text.At`, and string manipulation functions. Text cleaning techniques like `Text.Trim` and `Text.Replace` were applied to ensure data consistency.
   - **Derived Columns:** Conditional columns and custom columns were created to categorize data effectively. For instance, you might have created a `Day of Week` column from the `Date` for day-specific analysis.
   - **Calculated Fields:** The `Bill` column was derived by multiplying `Quantity` and `Price` columns, providing a quick view of transaction value.

**Data Modeling with Power Pivot**

1. **Import and Relationships:** The cleansed data was imported into Power Pivot to establish relationships between tables for comprehensive data exploration.
2. **Measures Creation:**
   - **Total Sales:** This measure calculates the total revenue generated by the coffee shop, typically the sum of the `Bill` column.
   - **Total Footfall:** This measure captures the total number of customer transactions, often the count of distinct entries in the `Customer ID` or a similar identifier column.
   - **Average Bill Value:** This measure calculates the average amount spent per customer transaction, typically the sum of `Bill` divided by the count of transactions.
   - **Average Quantity Sold:** This measure calculates the average number of coffee beverages sold per transaction, typically the sum of `Quantity` divided by the count of transactions.
   - **Additional Measures:** You might have created custom measures to analyze specific aspects of your business, such as sales by product type, popular combinations (e.g., coffee with pastries), or peak sales hours.

**Interactive Dashboard Design**

1. **Chart Selection:** A variety of charts were used to visualize the data effectively, including:
   - **Pie Charts:** Ideal for showcasing the distribution of sales across different categories, such as product types (e.g., lattes, cappuccinos, etc.) or cup sizes.
   - **Donut Charts:** Similar to pie charts but emphasize a specific data point within the circle.
   - **Bar Charts:** Excellent for comparing sales performance across different time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) or product categories.
   - **Line Charts:** Effective for identifying trends and seasonality patterns in sales data over time.
   - **Other Charts:** Depending on your specific data, consider using additional chart types like stacked bar charts for product combinations or scatter charts to explore relationships between variables.
2. **Slicers and Filters:** These interactive elements allow users to filter the dashboard for specific timeframes, product categories, or other desired criteria, enabling a more focused analysis.
3. **Formatting:** Clear and consistent formatting (colors, fonts, labels) was applied to enhance the dashboard's readability and aesthetics.
